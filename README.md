# Valve-Catalogue-WebGL

Showcasing a digital catalogue, took a generic valve model to showcase potential.

Basic concept is to digitize parts manuals, and combine them with typical vendor pdfs.
Being able to interact with and view a 3D model has many benefits such as:
- Visualization of individual parts
- Able to place more information in a smaller space
- Easy access through hosting on a website
